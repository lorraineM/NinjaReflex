   	- add an 'INIT' attribute on signal <$old_node_20> (optimization is then done without any risk)
   	- use the attribute 'signal_encoding user' to avoid onehot optimization

INFO:Xst:2371 - HDL ADVISOR - Logic functions respectively driving the data and gate enable inputs of this latch share common terms. This situation will potentially lead to setup/hold violations and, as a result, to simulation problems. This situation may come from an incomplete case statement (all selector values are not covered). You should carefully review if it was in your intentions to describe such a latch.
